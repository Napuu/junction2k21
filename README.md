Are you wasting your money on transmitting where nobody's listening?
Are you shittening the environment?

Introducing BLIP, the Base station transmission Level Interactive oPtimizer.
BLIP allows you to view anonymized location and movement data of your cellular network users, along with estimated dead zones you'd have with different transmission power levels.
This helps get insight into where you're wasting the most energy, and where you should spend more to provide an optimal user experience.

- Head over to [blip.nauruvers.io](https://Napuu.github.io/junction2k21/) to try out a demo of BLIP yourself!


### Disclaimer

Beware! When running the application without a proper discrete GPU, the simulation framerate can suffer.
